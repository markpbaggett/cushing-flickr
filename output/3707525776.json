I've got 2 &quot;knock out&quot; daughters, probably why I've got 4 grand kids now. \nI met my sweet wife skydiving when I first moved from Dallas to a Detroit suburb in 1984 she has 80 parachute jumps and I kinda left her as a skydivers widow. She quit jumping when we started having kids and me, well, every pretty weekend day in Michigan summers I would be trying to get on a load at one of the local drop zones. Anna and I celebrated our 25th. April a year ago she took me to Hawaii. Told you I was married to a sweetheart. She took me to Connecticut and Can\ncun this year. I think she likes to travel.\nAs a child I grew up in a affluent neighborhoodin Dallas, I mean these people had more money than, well you no what I mean all old oil money. My father was a rocket scientist, litterly, during the cold war there were 1000's of rocket scientists all across the nation. What they worked on was classified so I had to keep my mouth shut about it. Not that &quot;I&quot; knew much anyway. I remember once Dad coming home one evening and my father this tall 6ft. 6in. man with this booming voice announcing, &quot; son, were not going to be working on the Apollo or Lunar Excursion Module any longer.&quot; I thought he lost his job and with this Texas accent and deep concern said, &quot;Dad what are you going to do now.&quot;  He said, and you always had to look way up at him, &quot;Son were going to build something we can use and reuse.&quot; Thats when Shuttle program started. Is kinda funny last fall Shuttle flew for the last time. I didn't no it was taking off for the last time, that morning I woke up at my usually 5am EST to watch the news, then realized it was flying that morning. That night before my oldest grandson who is 4 now, he looked down at my desktop of my laptop computer in the garage and says, &quot;grand-pa whats that&quot; he was looking at a picture taken from the space station of the Shuttle getting ready to renter the earths atmosphere.\nI said to him, &quot; a rocket ship, Austen !!! &quot; Then I snatched him up took him to the basement to show him the pictures of patches they used on each mission. Lockheed Martin sent these to all the employs that worked on those launches and missions.\n\nmaybe more to come,\nJohn"
