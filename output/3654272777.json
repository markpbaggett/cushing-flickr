                    "_content": "Olive DeLucia, front row, second from right\n&quot;A LEGEND AT TEXAS A &amp; M&quot;\n\nComments of Charley Garner at the '44 CLASS DINNER Hilton Inn, 6:30 PM, March 26, 2000\n\nWe, the Class of 1944, are privileged to have among us tonight one of the living legends of Texas A&amp;M. In a moment, I hope to ask her to make a few remarks. But first I want to comment about her. Her name is Olive DeLucia. Once I overheard a man ask her, as we flew along in a transatlantic jet at 30,000 feet over Europe, how in the world did a blue eyed Scandinavian like you wind up with a name like DeLucia? Olive replied in a characteristically saucy manner, &quot;You marry an Italian, that's how&quot;.\n\nWe owe a debt of gratitute to her husband Ken DeLucia. They were later divorced, but during the course of their marriage, he brought her to Texas A&amp;M from New Jersey. The two of them got him through the School of Veterinary Medicine, and they had and still have two fine handsome sons, Don DeLucia and Scott DeLucia.\n\nWhen I first met her, she was a secretary in the Memorial Students Center, working with Wayne Starke, Buck Weirus , Dick Hervy, and others. There she started what was to become a blessing to Texas A&amp;M, her work with Reunions. She organized class parties and class reunions, and through her ingenuity and hard work the office of Class Programs was founded. Around her, the Association of Former Students as we know it was built. I believe she was the very first Manager of Class Programs. Around her and through her efforts, the entirely unique concept of 5 year class reunions, parties, mini-reunions, formal class muster programs, and just about everything that we have come to believe as our lives as Former Students of Texas A&amp;M, came into prominence -- she did not invent it, but she formalized and expanded it for us, and gave us our annual Class Programs.\n\nDuring her career on that job, she was most often the quiet guiding force behind the scenes. I often saw a number of our big wheels quietly looking to her for guidance - John David Crow, Buck Weirus, Randy Matson and others, would be on the podium, and during a break they would quietly walk to the side, whisper a question to Olive, receive her whispered advice into their ear, and return to the spotlight with confidence. Through her quiet grace, diligence, ingenuity, quick wit, good humor, self-confidence, and determination, she created Class Programs. Now, walk around the campus today and see the many tributes that have been erected to Olive DeLucia. Dr. John Heit '43 and his wife, Carolyn, have built a small park on the campus dedicated to the honor of Olive DeLucia; the grand piano in the Former Students Association Building has a brass plaque - Dedicated in honor of Olive Delucia. Her name is carved into the limestone of the Traditions Walls in the FSA. In my opinion, she knows more Texas Aggies than any Aggie alive. You, yourself, should take advantage of the opportunity to get to know her better by going on one of her now famous Traveling Aggie trips all over the world. They are not only adventures - they are fun. You will come back laughing. She has traveled over the world I believe more than Queen Elizabeth. If she ever meets you, she will never forget your name. Only yesterday I heard it said, Olive has become one of the great traditions of Texas A&amp;M, a living tradition - as part of our institution, much like King Gill, Pinky Downs, or Reveille and others. Soon I suspect she may rightly become known as Mrs. Texas A &amp; M. We in this Great Class do not have a monopoly or exclusive rights to her; she is known and loved by all Texas Aggies, and we are proud of that; but we in this Great Class are forever honored by the fact that our class sweetheart, the Sweetheart of the Class of 1944 -- is Olive DeLucia.."
